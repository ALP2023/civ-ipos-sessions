### Reflection Questions for Portfolio Activity: ICTPRG443

1. **Debugging Methodology**: 
    - Outline the debugging methodology you employed to identify the bug(s) in the Tic-Tac-Toe game? What debugging tools did you use and how did they aid in the debugging process? 
    - I would first perform an initial visual run through of the code to identify issues and fix.
    - Then I'll go through the following process
    - STEP1: Run the code
    - STEP2: Try to break it, identify an issue
    - STEP3: Review the Error Raised
    - STEP4: Go to the code that raises the error
    - STEP5: Set break points by clicking in the left-hand margin next to the line of code where I want to start debugging. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint.

2. **Role of Documentation**: 
    - Did the existing documentation (comments, docstrings, onboarding documentation, etc.) help you in understanding and debugging the code? Provide examples.

3. **Updating Documentation**: 
    - How did you go about updating the documentation? What information did you include to make the codebase easier to understand for future developers?

4. **Reflection on Testing**: 
    - How did writing test cases help you in the debugging process? Did the act of writing a test case provide any insights into the bug you were trying to fix?

5. **Testing Challenges and Strategies**: 
    - What challenges did you encounter while writing and running the test cases? What strategies did you employ to overcome these challenges?

6. **General Reflection**: 
    - How did this activity help you in understanding the importance of debugging, testing, and documentation in a real-world coding project? What are the key takeaways for you from this portfolio activity?
